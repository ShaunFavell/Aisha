Hello World, my name is Dr Shaun Favell - I am the founder of The Aisha Project

I am working on a fun. follow along, open source engineering project to build an affordable humanoid robot that will interact using an AI LLM. The key purpose of the project is for it to be replicated by hobbyists who have access to home equipment such as 3D printing, Arduino board building, and simple DIY skills. It is a follow along project, that invites others to contribute and build something amazing and fun, and accessible to those on a restricted budget.

The project is a combination of engineering and software, and is being presented through social media with tutorials helping developers and builders recreate the work done. Sponsorship will help with development costs and materials, which will keep costs down for those who are replicating the successes of the project.

Many thanks for any support you give. Access to all digital products such as 3D printer files and code will be free to anyone whether they wish to contribute or not.
